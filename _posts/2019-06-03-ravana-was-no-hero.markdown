title:  "Stop Making Ravana a Hero!"
---

I see lot of people making argument over ‘Why Ravana was good human being, sometimes even better than Rama’.

We need to stop making hero out of Ravana. Some believe, since he did not touch Sita once even after kidnapping her, he was kind of hero. He wasn’t! WhatsApp university and some TV shows have spoiled it for all of us.

Once Ravana was resting in camp near to Kubera’s city. While he was enjoying nature and mountains, he saw Rambha, wife of Nalakubera passing by, and he felt prey to his lust.

When Rambha pleaded and in all fairness told Ravana that she is married to Nalakubera, son of Kubera and thus is ‘daughter-in-law’ to him (Since, Kubera was brother of Ravana). Ravana’s Response Was:

> “I can understand that if you are the wife of my son Indrajit. But you are the wife of my brother’s son! The plea which you have given in the words, ‘I am your daughter-in-law’ holds good in the case of those who have (only) one husband. Celestial nymphs have no husband nor are gods committed to a single wife such is the eternal law obtaining in the realm of gods.”
>

Ravana violated her that day, while she kept pleading. Rambha told her husband Nalakubera about the incident. Furious with the incident, he took some water in palms of his hands and cursed Ravana:

>“Since O blessed lady, you stand violated by him perforce, unwilling as you were, he shall no longer be able to approach any other young woman who is unwilling to accept him. When (however) stricken with love, he will violate a woman who is unwilling to approach him, his head will actually be split into seven pieces that (very moment).”

>– Valmiki Ramayana, Uttara Kanda, Canto XXVI, Sloka 55

It explains why Ravana did not violate Sita. He did not violate Sita because of morals but if he’d tried, he would have died immediately.
